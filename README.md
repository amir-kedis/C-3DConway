This my trial to combine 3D graphics with Conway's Game of Life and practice my C skills.
The idea is to visualize the game of life in 3D space, every cube of the top layer represents a cell in the game of life.
each layer represents a generation so the y axis is the time axis. colors represent the number of neighbors of each cell.

## üöÄ To run the simulation install raylib and run the following command:

```bash
make
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Controls

- `WASD+QE` or `mouse`: Move camera
- `P`: Pause simulation
- `R`: Randomize grid
- `C`: Change color shift type
- `SPACE`: Step simulation
- `ENTER`: Toggle Rotation
- `?`: Show Instructions
